### **üöÄ API Gateway: OKRs & User Stories**

#### **üéØ Objective**
Design and build a **high-performance, scalable, and secure API Gateway** to manage and control API traffic efficiently, ensuring rate limiting, authentication, logging, and monitoring.

---

## ‚úÖ **Key Results (OKRs)**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Scalability**  
- Maintain **99.99% uptime** for the API Gateway.  
- Ensure **latency is ‚â§50ms** for 99% of API requests.  
- Handle **10,000+ concurrent API requests** without degradation.  
- Implement **horizontal scaling** to support increased traffic loads.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Access Control**  
- Implement **OAuth 2.0, API Keys, and JWT authentication** with 99% success in blocking unauthorized access.  
- Enforce **rate limiting per API key, IP, or user level** to prevent abuse.  
- Log and **monitor 100% of requests** to detect anomalies or attacks.  
- Block **95%+ of detected malicious requests** (DDoS, SQL injection, XSS, etc.).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ API Management & Usability**  
- Ensure **99% successful routing of API requests** to the correct backend services.  
- Provide **real-time analytics and logging** for at least 95% of API calls.  
- Implement a **developer-friendly API documentation system** with OpenAPI support.  
- Support **gRPC and RESTful API proxies** with backward compatibility.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Observability & Monitoring**  
- Implement **100% request logging** to a centralized log storage.  
- Track **API response times, error rates, and request volumes** with real-time dashboards.  
- Provide **alerts within 30 seconds** of detecting API failure or latency spikes.

## üìä **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
- **API Gateway uptime:** 99.99%.  
- **Average request latency:** ‚â§50ms.  
- **Authentication success rate:** 99%.  
- **Rate limiting enforcement success:** 99.5%.  
- **Error rate detection:** ‚â§1% unhandled errors.  

---

## ‚è± **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**  
- **Response time for 99% of requests:** ‚â§50ms.  
- **Authentication verification:** ‚â§20ms.  
- **Uptime guarantee:** 99.99%.  

---

## üìà **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**  
- **95% of valid API requests processed successfully within 50ms.**  
- **99.9% successful logging of all requests and responses.**  
- **99% uptime for the API Gateway across all deployments.**
